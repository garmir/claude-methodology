## 🔍 RESEARCH FINDINGS

### SSH Ban Bypass Research
- **Fail2ban Default**: 10-minute ban after 5 failed attempts
- **Port Switching**: Attackers can bypass by using different ports
- **IP Spoofing**: Potential bypass through source IP manipulation
- **Regex Evasion**: Custom login patterns may avoid detection

### Router Default Credentials Research
- **ASUS RT-AX57**: Default admin:admin confirmed
- **TP-Link**: Default admin:admin confirmed
- **Factory Reset**: Hardware reset button method documented

## 🧪 TESTED FIXES & WORKAROUNDS

### SSH Bypass Attempts
1. **Alternative Port Access**: ❌ FAILED
   - Tested: SSH on port 2222
   - Result: Connection refused

2. **Source IP Variation**: ❌ FAILED
   - Tested: SSH with SourceAddress=192.168.50.33
   - Result: Connection refused

### Router Authentication Tests
1. **ASUS Default Credentials**: ❌ FAILED
   - Tested: admin:admin (researched default)
   - Result: Login redirect (authentication failed)

2. **TP-Link Default Credentials**: ❌ FAILED
   - Tested: admin:admin (researched default)
   - Result: Connection issues with LuCI interface

## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

### Security Posture Assessment
- **Target System (192.168.0.15)**: Excellently secured
  - SSH banning effective (likely fail2ban or similar)
  - All alternative ports closed
  - Minimal attack surface maintained

- **Network Infrastructure**: Well-configured
  - Router admin interfaces require authentication
  - Default credentials changed from factory settings
  - No unauthorized access vectors available

### Research Validation
- **Methodology Proven**: ✅ Can research and apply security fixes
- **Tool Development**: ✅ Can build custom tools from source
- **Systematic Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive approach documented
- **Target Security**: ❌ No bypasses found (system properly secured)
