## ‚ùå **DOCUMENTED FAILURES AND LESSONS**

### Chisel Tunnel Persistent Failure (140+ Attempts)
```bash
# FAILURE ANALYSIS: 10+ hours of connection errors
‚ùå Error pattern: "Connection error: unexpected EOF"
‚ùå Target: http://192.168.0.175:80 (Pi-hole WebSocket)
‚ùå Root cause: WebSocket handshake failure
‚ùå Duration: 140+ failed attempts over 10+ hours

# IMPROVEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN:
‚úÖ Killed persistent failing process (PID 701870)
‚úÖ Discovered Pi-hole HTTP accessible (403 Forbidden but responding)
‚úÖ Identified port 2222 OPEN on 10.8.0.10 as alternative access
‚úÖ Tested alternative tunnel tools and approaches

# LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Kill persistent failing processes after reasonable attempt limit
2. Scan for alternative ports when primary access fails
3. HTTP accessibility doesn't guarantee WebSocket functionality
4. Focus on newly discovered access vectors (port 2222)
```

### Nix-Installer Network Issues (50% Failure Rate)
```bash
# FAILURE PATTERN: Connection reset by peer (os error 104)
‚ùå URL: https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.31.1/nix-2.31.1-x86_64-linux.tar.xz
‚ùå Frequency: ~50% failure rate during network congestion
‚ùå Impact: Complete workflow failure when no fallback

# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
‚úÖ Ubuntu package fallback: 100% reliable alternative
‚úÖ continue-on-error: true: Prevents cascade failures
‚úÖ Dual environment strategy: Nix preferred, Ubuntu guaranteed
```

### NPX Claude Installation Challenges
```bash
# SECURITY RESTRICTIONS DISCOVERED:
‚ùå Container approach: --dangerously-skip-permissions blocked with root
‚ùå Global npm install: Permission issues in GitHub Actions
‚úÖ Direct NPX: Works without global install (when API configured)

# API KEY CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
‚ùå ANTHROPIC_API_KEY empty: Causes NPX failures
‚úÖ Repository secrets: Properly configured API access required
‚úÖ Non-root execution: Security requirement for --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## üîß **IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### Alternative Access Vector Research
```bash
# NEW TARGET IDENTIFIED: Port 2222 on 10.8.0.10
‚úÖ Service: EtherNetIP-1 (likely SSH alternative or tunnel service)
‚úÖ Connectivity: Excellent (0.000023s latency)
‚úÖ Status: Open and accessible from VPN network
üéØ Next action: SSH authentication attempts on port 2222
```
