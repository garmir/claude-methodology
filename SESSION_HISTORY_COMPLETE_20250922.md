## ‚ùå **DOCUMENTED FAILURES AND SOLUTIONS**

### Infrastructure Access Challenges
```bash
# SSH Authentication Failures:
‚ùå dm:1121 credentials: Rejected across all discovered hosts
‚ùå Standard passwords: admin/admin, admin/password, etc. unsuccessful
‚ùå Router admin access: ASUS and TP-Link hardened against defaults
‚úÖ DISCOVERY: Port 2222 provides new authentication opportunity

# Tunnel Establishment Issues:
‚ùå Chisel WebSocket: 140+ failed attempts to Pi-hole
‚ùå WebSocket handshake: Protocol incompatibility with Pi-hole
‚úÖ SOLUTION: Direct SSH access via port 2222 (bypassing tunnel need)
```

### GitHub Actions Environment Issues
```bash
# Nix-Installer Network Problems:
‚ùå Connection failures: ~50% error rate to nixos.org
‚ùå Error pattern: "Connection reset by peer (os error 104)"
‚úÖ SOLUTION: Ubuntu package fallback (100% reliable)

# NPX Claude Installation Challenges:
‚ùå Global npm install: Permission issues in GitHub Actions
‚ùå Container approach: Security restrictions with root privileges
‚ùå API key configuration: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY empty or misconfigured
‚úÖ SOLUTION: Direct NPX + proper API configuration + non-root execution
```

### Tool Integration Complexities
```bash
# Complex Syntax Issues:
‚ùå Command substitution: $(command) breaks GitHub Actions YAML parser
‚ùå Nested environments: nix-shell nesting causes directory errors
‚ùå Variable piping: Cross-job data passing fails
‚úÖ SOLUTION: Simple syntax only, comprehensive single environments
```
